# MI Skin for [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/)

> MI stands for Material Inspired.

## Downloading

Go to [releases](https://github.com/Bauke/mi-skin/releases) and download the `.osk` file. 

## Developing

### Requirements

#### Software

* [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) or [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)

#### Fonts
* [Roboto Medium](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto)
* [Roboto Condensed](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto%20Condensed)
* [Crete Round](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Crete%20Round)

### Installation

>I use Yarn however you can do this all with NPM too. Be aware that some commands are different.

Clone the repository and run `yarn`.

After cloning and installing run `yarn test` to see if [svg-to-img](https://github.com/etienne-martin/svg-to-img) is working correctly.

To build the skin you can run `yarn build`. This will create a folder with the skin files and a `.osk`

### Workflow

The easiest way I've found to design elements is to use a text editor such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and install a [SVG Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cssho.vscode-svgviewer) extension. Once you're satisfied with what it looks like in the preview you can build the files and open the `.osk`.

## Issues

If you encounter any problems with the skin, developing the skin or want to suggest something to change. [Open an issue](https://github.com/Bauke/mi-skin/issues) or contact me on Discord: `Bauke#7065`

## License

I've chosen for no license as it's an osu! skin and not some revolutionary project. Don't be a fuck and steal elements, that's not cool. I encourage you to mix and match but always give credit where credit is due. Thanks!
