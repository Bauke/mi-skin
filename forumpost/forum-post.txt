[heading]MI Skin[/heading]
MI stands for [url=https://material.io/]Material[/url] Inspired.

My first skin, born out of my inability to find a skin that I could play with consistently and also liked the look of. This skin is open-source on [url=https://github.com/Bauke/mi-skin]GitHub[/url] and open to contributions. It's created using [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics]Scalable Vector Graphics[/url] which are then converted to the PNG files used by osu!. Because they are SVGs this allows me to make 1 version for both the SD and HD version and then just double the resolution for the SVG to be converted. [s]However this is [url=https://github.com/Bauke/mi-skin/issues/4]not yet implemented[/url].[/s] Starting from v0.4.0 both regular and @2x are supported!
If you know your way around JavaScript and/or SVGs you're more than welcome to [url=https://github.com/Bauke/mi-skin]help out![/url]

If you want to suggest a change or alternative version of an element don't hesitate to [url=https://github.com/Bauke/mi-skin/issues/new]submit an issue[/url] on GitHub or contact me on Discord: [b]Bauke#7065[/b]

[box=Downloads]For now the download will only be available through GitHub to manage the versions better. When the point comes for a major (1.0.0) release I'll make it available through Puush and the likes. If you can't see where to download it's the file called [b]MI_Skin.osk[/b] just under [b]Assets[/b]. Starting from v0.5.0 all modes are skinned!

[box=Disclaimer]This is still very much a work in progress, there's still issues and things to fix as well as some extra features to work on.[/box]
